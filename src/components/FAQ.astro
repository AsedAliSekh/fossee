        <b>1. Will the winners of the “National OpenHardware-IoT Geospatial Hackathon 2024” receive any refund or is there any prize/ award given?</b> <br> <br>
        <b>Answer:</b> As this is a national-level activity, supported through the FOSSEE project, National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT), the prospective winners shall be given ‘prizes/awards ONLY’, based on their performance, category-wise (themes). The winners shall also be eligible for applying to the coveted “IIT Bombay FOSSEE Geospatial + OpenHardware Internship & Summer Fellowship 2024”, and other flagship activities.
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Is there any filtration before starting the hackathon?</b> <br> <br>
        <b>Answer:</b> Yes, there is a filtration process in place which shall review all the proposals before allowing the individual participant/ team(s) into the main phase of the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon”. The aspirants must (i) register themselves/ their team, (ii). Upload their proposal, (iii). The core organizing committee (IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS/OSHW + IITTNiF + ICFOSS) will evaluate the proposals, (iv). Accepted proposals shall be informed via email. <br><br>
        Note: The project proposals are reviewed by the core committee and shall ensure their alignment with the hackathon's theme and objectives.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. Can we use any proprietary hardware for other components if the open source is not available for that item?</b> <br> <br>
        <b>Answer:</b>Participants are permitted to utilize proprietary hardware or components in the absence of open-source alternatives. This should not exceed 40%. However, they (participating team(s)/ individuals) must adhere to any licensing agreements or restrictions related to proprietary technologies. It is to be noted and essential that all designs and code submitted must adhere to the CC-BY-SA license requirements.
        <br><br>
        <b>4. What are the judging criteria for project evaluation?</b> <br> <br>
        <b>Answer:</b>The judging criteria typically include factors such as novelty, methodology, innovation, technical implementation, usability, impact, and presentation (report) quality. Each project is evaluated based on these criteria to determine the winners.<br>

        Note: The project proposal and final submissions must adhere to the mandates laid by the “IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS team” at all times. By participating in the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon” the teams agree that the decision taken by the ‘Core Organizing Committee’ and/or the ‘IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS & OSHW’ team(s) shall be final and non-appealable.
        <br><br>
        <b>5. Is there a registration fee to participate in the hackathon?</b> <br> <br>
        <b>Answer:</b>NO! Participation in the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geopstial Hackathon” is completely ‘FREE OF COST/ NO FEE”.<br><br>

        <p><b>6. Is there any format for submitting reports and presentations?</b><br>
            Answer: YES! The report and presentation template shall be shared by the core committee during the ‘Orientation phase’.</p>
            
            <p><b>7. How will the hackathon be conducted? Is it an online event or will there be physical venues?</b><br>
            Answer: The main phase of the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon” will exclusively take place in ‘ONLINE MODE’ only.<br>
            Note: The ‘Grand Finale’ of the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon” shall be conducted in offline mode. For the ‘Grand Finale’ only the teams shortlisted for the final stage/ round will be invited to participate.</p>
            
            <p><b>8. What level of expertise in IoT and geospatial technologies is expected from participants?</b><br>
            Answer: Participants/ Team(s) with varying levels of expertise in IoT and geospatial technologies are welcome to participate. The hackathon shall serve as a platform for beginners, intermediate, and advanced-level participants, with lots of opportunities to learn and collaborate.<br>
            Note: The proposals for the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon 2024” can be submitted under two broad categories,<br>
            (i). Purely ‘IoT’ based (OR)<br>
            (ii). A blend of GIS + IoT (Special prizes/ awards are to be given for this category)</p>
            
            <p><b>9. Can participants use pre-existing IoT devices or hardware prototypes for their projects, or do they need to develop new solutions from scratch?</b><br>
            Answer: The participants/ participating team(s) are encouraged to develop their solutions/ prototypes from scratch. But, to spread awareness about “OpenSource Hardware-IoT’ and ‘GIS’ technologies in all domains, we encourage the students cutting across domains to give it a try. Hence, we do allow participants to use pre-existing IoT devices or hardware prototypes for their projects, as long as they meet the project requirements and objectives. All designs and code submitted must adhere to the CC-BY-SA license requirements.<br>
            Note: The decision of the ‘Core Organizing Committee’ of the National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon, and/or the ‘IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS & OSHW’ team(s) shall be final and non-appealable, in all circumstances.</p>
